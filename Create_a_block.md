How to create a Block
=====================

Create a gist at

https://gist.github.com/

clone it into your computer

```
$ git clone https://gist.github.com/3b54550c9a47cc617e.git
```

make sure you have at least:

* index.html
* README.md
* thumbnail.png (230x130)

Once your changes are ready, commit them using git and push them up to GitHub:

```
$ git commit -am 'Made some changes.'
$ git push
```

Now that youâ€™ve made a gist, you can view it on bl.ocks.org! Simply copy the gist number and replace the URL. 

For example,

https://gist.github.com/mbostock/4060606

becomes

http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606
